			<p>The hotel is located two blocks across the street from Columbia College. It is near the downtown shopping area and close to many good restaurants. It has 120 units of different kinds of room. They are good for occasions of family reunions, weddings, and small conferences. Many of their visitors are alumni of Columbia College and Cougar fans who came to see the games.

Cougar Inn is very nice and affable. All rooms are elegantly arranged with Victorian antiques, custom crafted wall coverings, and beautiful paintings. Free local calls and free broadband wireless Internet in every room. Two swimming pools and three laundry rooms are in the facility. Parking is free for customers.

A generous hot breakfast buffet is served from 7am to 9am weekdays and 7am to 10am weekends. Cougar Inn has a special kid’s pool, a children’s playground, and many activities during the holidays. It also has a fully equipped gym with a capacity of holding 40 people.

Conferences for up to 300 participants can be held in the hotel. Larger conferences are possible with prior arrangement with Columbia College.
